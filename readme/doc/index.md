## Goals

To build on top of

- unstyled design system like radix-ui or headless-ui (somehow works)
- sync tokens with Figma (works)
- write documents and storybook (best format?)
- used in Next.js 13 projets as a normal package (somehow works, styling is off sometimes, client component only)
- ~~publish as ESM packages (?)~~
- ~~or in Framer as URL import (not working)~~

## Setting up a design system

Most examples I tried (mui, chakra, headless) cannot be imported and used, and there are some [typing issues](https://studio.backlight.dev/edit/bfzeo1pWt4DALHCDRGhV/listbox/src/listbox.tsx?p=doc). I am not sure what's the best way to do it.

So far the [tailwind example](https://studio.backlight.dev/edit/bfzeo1pWt4DALHCDRGhV/menu/?p=doc) works with some errors

- best folder structure?
- documentation for dockit
- doc template?
- fast development without publish package (link?)
- how to setup folder structure
- my story display as string
