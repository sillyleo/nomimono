- dockit tailwind example doesn't work
- [avatar story doesn't work, show up as string](https://studio.backlight.dev/edit/xRXzm1XdJMvuvB1JFVqF/avatar/index.stories.ts?p=stories&branch=design-system@Mr0XzynRgURqMyGu0rU9wtkQgfV2)
- cli link doesn't work

  - command is `npx backlight@latest link @sulky-security-0ia5z/w3b --branch "design-system@Mr0XzynRgURqMyGu0rU9wtkQgfV2"`
  - but in package.json the name is `"name": "@backlight-dev/w3b"`

  - and it complained `ERROR: Design system @sulky-security-0ia5z/w3b does not seem to exist`
  - Notes: my workspace is `sillyleo` and design system is `w3b`
