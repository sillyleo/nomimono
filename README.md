Fonts are not specific but prioritize [Sk-Modernist](https://seankanedesign.gumroad.com/l/sk-modernist) for heading and
Inter for body.

## Sk-Modernist

Buy [here](https://seankanedesign.gumroad.com/l/sk-modernist)

and add to `/fonts` or any place where css can access. (Relative to your public URL, not to local files.)

Create font classnames:

You can then use it like fontFamily: "SkModernistBold"

Access with `SkModernistBold` or `SkModernistRegular`.

## Inter

`pnpm install @fontsource/inter-tight`

and

`import "@fontsource/inter-tight"`
