# Portable Mode

Consume the design tokens from Nomimono in your projects.

Suitable for composing components that are not tied to a specific design system, or for components that are not yet supported by Nomimono.

## Using Nomimono's `styled`

Import `styled` from `@sayaww/nomimono` and use it like you would with stitches.

```jsx
import { styled } from "@sayaww/nomimono";
```

To apply the dark theme: add this on the top of your app:

```jsx
import { stitchesDarkTheme } from "@sayaww/nomimono";

// In App.tsx
<div className={stitchesDarkTheme} />;
```
